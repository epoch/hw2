This is my submission for MTA lab. The code is split into three files:

* mta.rb – the "program" that asks the user for information and prints out the route
* mta_route.rb – the actual route algorithm
* mta_test.rb – for testing

To run the tests:

		$ ruby mta_test.rb

To run the program:

		$ ruby mta.rb
