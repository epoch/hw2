Have a database for movies on your own local area

So each movie you request only once from imdb

You take the data, store it in the database yourselves

And if somebody else comes looking for it later, youâ€™ve kept a copy of all of that stuff

One time it will go off to imbd and get the data

The second time it will remember the poster

Got to imdb once, to get list of all sharknado movies

But keep a copy of whatever else in the database so we only need to request things  once

Need two things for this:

Create table movies
Put your fields in it 
In this table work out what things u care about from imbd to store

And you will need a class called Movie

So you can do things like movie.find




at the point they click on the movie thy want, store it in the database

.save on the database
